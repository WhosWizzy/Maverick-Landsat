#Prerequisites:

- USGS M2M Api Access
- WRS-2 World Bound KML File
- Just check server.js for node packages. I couldn't be bother anymore at this point.


> [!WARNING]
> File is probably all over the place, may even have missing content that I forgot to push, probably a lot of deprecated content as well. Not meant to be used commercially, barely a prototype.
